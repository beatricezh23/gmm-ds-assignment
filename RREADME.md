# Detecting Missing Production Data

The production mode is coal. If the function checks each production mode, the program will crash because DE doesn’t have nuclear production.

# Detecting Abnormal Production Data
The code includes a HistoricalData class to calculate rolling data average and standard deviation. However, I wasn't able to make the code work as expected. It required further refinement and debugging to properly calculate statistics and detect anomalies in production data.

# Final Note
Thanks for the opportunity to work on the assignment. and I’ve learned I have some skill gaps in accomplishing the task, and taking on a role as data scientist. I would love to keep following the company’s updates. Once there are more suitable opportunities for my skillset, I will apply again.
